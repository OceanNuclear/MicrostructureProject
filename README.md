# MicrostructureProject
Microstructure modelling project in Spring term 2018. This repository contains scripts and results of two tasks:

## Calibration
A windows executable was given, which takes in 3 parameters as input and creates a force-displacement curve as the output.
The objective is to find the set of parameters that gives a curve that fits most closely to the reference curve, and verify that it fits those 3 parameters used to generate this reference curve.

## curve fitting
10 experimental force-displacement curves were given (600 - 1000 degrees Celcius at 100 degrees step size, at either fast or slow strain rate, ); the set of 3 parameters that best fit each of those curve were needed.
